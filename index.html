          <p>Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked

            wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</p>

          <p>crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that
            responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="pill">1962</span>
          <p>Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help

          <p>states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
            modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are
            not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p>
